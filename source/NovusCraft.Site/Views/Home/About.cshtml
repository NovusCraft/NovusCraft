		<h1>Hi, I'm Arnold and I love writing great software.</h1>
	</header>
	<p>I live in London and work at Novus Craft (my first company, founded in 2010). At Novus Craft, I develop solutions using .NET, ASP.NET MVC and Sitecore and a variety of front-end technologies.</p>
	<p>Software development has been my passion since I was 18 and I am a big tech geek. My interests include hardware as well as software - I have assembled over a dozen PC (media centres, workstations, gaming rigs).</p>
