		<h1>Hi, I'm Arnold and I love writing great software</h1>
	</header>
	<p>I live in London and work at Novus Craft (my company, founded in 2010). At Novus Craft, I develop solutions using .NET, ASP.NET MVC and Sitecore and a variety of other front-end and back-end technologies.</p>
	<p>Software development has been my passion since I was very young and I am a big tech geek. When I am not working on commercial projects, I spend a lot of time reading blogs, books (on Kindle) and practicing my craft by contributing to open-source projects.</p>
